## Morning Atonement 

Some mornings I open my eyes and see if

Something memorable from the fresh dreams

Might have struck an interesting chord 

Half times, no, which means

Half times, a sticky tendril of some sort

Has seeped in my mind 

If I were sensitive enough 

I would have tracked its root

Which must connect with a thing,

Which must further connect with a person

Whom I either love or hate

Or have multiple and ambivalent feelings

But inevitably, I am just an ordinary man

In this ordinary world, where dreams perish

As quick as the apex of sunrise 

And consciousness fickle as moonlight 

When a day recedes into night

Where dreams will again scuttle in shadows 

You may wonder 

What a fine line between 

The life you have always dreamed 

And the life is actually being dreamed
