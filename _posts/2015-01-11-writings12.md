/C. S. Luc

The soft touch of hand
Boarding on your own body--
What was left of passion,
And such singular amorism
Void of the other.

Still, every gentle sound arose
In a rhythm secretly screaming 
To you, and you only.
Each wonderful movement of 
your smitten self, 
followed forcefully
The revolutionary chords inside
In a way, you listened to 
your own playing
With precision and perfection
Of carnal physics, of inner music.

Those lonely neurological explosions
Repeated, but with no consequence 
However you fold, or unfold,
It did so in silence, beneath
A magnificent shell, spangled 
With longing, which yearned 
Over and over, 
In poetic sadness---
Oh, Love,
Come to me.
