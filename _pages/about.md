**C. S. Luc**

C.S. Luc is akin to the representational art of the classical
realism and the color expression of the Impressionism
heritage. He has been focusing on the portraiture and figure
painting in recent years. He was the disciple of the late
American portrait painter Nelson Shanks and also studied
neoclassical realism painting in the Florence Academy of Fine
Arts and St. Petersburg Fine Arts, Sculpture, and
Architecture Institute. In his paintings, C.S. Luc endeavors to
grasp and display the inner core of the subjectsâ€™ souls.
