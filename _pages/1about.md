C.S. Luc is akin to the representational art of the classical
realism and the color expression of the Impressionism
heritage. He has been focusing on the portraiture and figure
painting in recent years. He  studied neoclassical realism painting in the Florence Academy of Fine Arts and St. Petersburg Fine Arts, Sculpture, and Architecture Institute. In his paintings, C.S. Luc endeavors to grasp and display the inner core of the subjectsâ€™ souls.
